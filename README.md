# route.ai  
**The future of public transit**

## Overview

**route.ai** is a transit optimization platform designed to improve public transportation for youth in suburban areas, starting with the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). By combining real-time data analysis with user feedback, we help governments and transit agencies make smarter decisions without costly infrastructure changes.

## The Problem

Youth living in suburban regions like the GTA often face limited access to public transit. With fewer routes, inflexible schedules, and long wait times, commuting becomes inefficient and unreliable—especially for students and teens without access to a car. Building new routes or stops is expensive and slow.

## The Solution

**route.ai** provides a two-part solution:

### 1. Government Platform

- **Dynamic Routing**  
  Routes are updated based on real-time ridership data and demand, reducing dormant lines and improving efficiency.

- **Feedback Filtering**  
  Riders can submit feedback through the app. Our platform filters and analyzes this input to surface trends and actionable suggestions.

- **Insight Generation**  
  Uses large language models to interpret data and feedback at scale, helping transit authorities make informed decisions.

- **Data Visualization**  
  Offers clean, intuitive dashboards to help planners quickly identify performance gaps and opportunities.

### 2. Mobile App

- **Smart Stop Detection**  
  Automatically detects whether a user is walking to, waiting at, or on a bus—no manual check-in required.

- **Quick Feedback Submission**  
  Riders can report issues or make suggestions in a few taps.

- **SafeRide Profiles for Minors**  
  Allows underage users to connect their accounts to a parent or guardian, with options to restrict data collection.
